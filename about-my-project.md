## About My Project

Queryable Computer Vision For Traffic Video Analysis

Problem:
There is a significant research gap in the timely detection and response to crimes in dangerous campus areas. Current solutions, such as the POM device, which alerts campus security when clicked three times, are insufficient in preventing late arrival of help during incidents like shootings, robberies, and assaults.

Approach:
During this project, I will develop a system that detects suspicious activities to foster a safer community. The system will include:

  - Tracking jaywalkers by focusing on the region of interest (ROI).
  - Detecting red light driver violators using a traffic light detection system that identifies red, yellow, and green lights through HSV.
  - Building the system to be queryable using MySQL for effective data management and retrieval.

Expected Outcome:
The project aims to enhance my machine learning skills and ultimately provide a safer environment, starting with our University's community and expanding to a broader society.

An additional implementation I want to include is the EasyOCR system that analyzes the license plates of passing vehicles, to make it easier to trace back the violators. However, a possible roadblock I imagine encountering is the incorrect identification of number plates if it's halfway blocked by other obstacles (vehicles, people, animals), or if the video quality isn't good enough.
