The first session of the week was a writing session, which, to me, was the most insightful and engaging. We had a valuable session with Dr. Pandey, who provided insights on writing research papers and the importance of clear communication, especially in funded research. Her guidance helped me understand how to present our project and the power of writing our ideas in a clear, engaging and effective manner, which may even assist in gaining recognition in the future.

This week following the writing session has been a productive one for our project on the queryable computer vision pipeline for traffic video analysis. We started by researching the YOLO series, from YOLOv1 to YOLOv8, learning about the improvements and advancements made in each version. This gave us a solid understanding of the evolution of object detection technology.

Midweek, we focused on YOLOv8 and its use cases, particularly in object detection and segmentation. This research was essential as we began coding with the ultralytics libraryâ€™s pre-trained models. Our initial code was able to accurately identify a variety of objects, including people, cars, trucks, and even everyday items like toasters and hair dryers. Overall, this week has been about building a strong foundation, making progress in our coding efforts, and gaining valuable insights from our mentors.
