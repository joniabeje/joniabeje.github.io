### Accomplishments

This week, we dedicated our efforts to researching the YOLO series, starting with YOLOv1 and progressing through to YOLOv8. We studied the various improvements and advancements made in each version, gaining a solid understanding of the evolution of object detection technology. Midweek, we shifted our focus specifically to YOLOv8, exploring its use cases in object detection and segmentation. Following this, we began writing the initial lines of code using the Ultralytics library’s pre-trained models.

### Results Achieved

By the end of the week, our initial coding efforts were successful. The pre-trained models accurately identified a wide range of objects, including people, cars, trucks, cats, dogs, toasters, and hair dryers. The models demonstrated high confidence and accuracy in object detection, which was a promising start for our project.

### Findings

Through our research, we discovered the significant advancements made from YOLOv1 to YOLOv8. Each version improved upon its predecessor in terms of accuracy, speed, and the ability to detect and segment objects in various environments. This in-depth understanding of YOLOv8’s capabilities and its applications in object detection and segmentation was crucial for our project’s progress.

### Algorithm(s) Used

We utilized the YOLOv8 object detection and segmentation algorithms, specifically leveraging the pre-trained models available in the Ultralytics library. These models are designed to detect and identify 80 different objects, providing a robust foundation for our traffic video analysis pipeline.

### Issues/Frustrations Encountered

This week, I did not encounter any significant challenges or frustrations. The project has been straightforward, and the tasks assigned were clear and manageable. The support from our mentors has been excellent, ensuring we stay on track with our objectives.

### Other Relevant Experiences Gained During the Week

The first session of the week was a writing session, which, to me, was the most insightful and engaging. We had a valuable session with Dr. Pandey, who provided insights on writing research papers and the importance of clear communication, especially in funded research. Her guidance helped me understand how to present our project and the power of writing our ideas in a clear, engaging and effective manner, which may even assist in gaining recognition in the future.
