### Accomplishments
This week, we focused on enhancing our SQL database integration for tracking and logging detections from the YOLOv8 object detection model. We successfully restructured our database schema to include additional columns for traffic signal color and jaywalking status. This allowed us to log comprehensive data on each detected object, including whether they were jaywalking and the traffic signal status at the time of detection. 

### Results
By the end of the week, our SQL database was effectively capturing detailed information for each frame processed by the detection system. This included accurate logging of detected objects, their classification, traffic signal status, and jaywalking status. The database maintained consistency and integrity, providing a robust framework for analyzing traffic and pedestrian behavior.

### Findings
We discovered that integrating SQL with real-time object detection requires careful planning and structuring of the database schema to ensure it captures all necessary details without redundancy. The addition of traffic signal and jaywalking status columns significantly enhanced our data analysis capabilities, enabling more detailed and actionable insights.

### Algorithm(s) used
We continued utilizing the YOLOv8 object detection model combined with HSV color space-based detection for traffic light color identification. The detections were then logged into the SQL database with added columns for traffic signal color and jaywalking status to provide a comprehensive dataset.

### Issues/Frustrations Encountered
The main challenge encountered was ensuring the SQL database could handle real-time data insertion without causing latency issues. We had to optimize our database schema and insertion logic to maintain real-time performance. Additionally, managing concurrent detections and ensuring data integrity in the database required careful handling of SQL transactions and error management.

### Presentation
I successfully delivered my mid-summer research presentation and demoed the video to the public, showcasing our progress and the practical applications of our detection system with SQL integration. This presentation highlighted the real-world impact and potential of our work, demonstrating the value of our enhanced data logging and analysis capabilities.
