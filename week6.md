Due to having COVID-19, which restricted my breathing, caused headaches, migraines, coughing, and a runny nose, I was prevented from going to school to practice my mid-summer presentation, and I didn't want to infect anybody in the workplace. Still, I focused on acomplishing what I could on Thursday and Friday and completed all of my weekly tasks.

### Accomplishments
This week, we implemented the detection of red light dashers by identifying vehicles running red lights when they pass through a designated intersection ROI while the traffic light is red. We also researched SQL and specifically MySQL to make the data queryable, preparing for future integration to store and manage detected incidents.

### Results
The updated script successfully detected and labeled vehicles running red lights within the specified ROIs, accurately identifying red light dashers in real-time.

### Findings
Combining YOLOv8 for object detection with HSV color space processing for traffic light color identification is an effective method. The use of morphological operations and contour detection significantly improved the accuracy of isolating traffic lights from complex backgrounds.

### Issues/Frustrations Encountered
The main issue was finding a clip of a red light dasher that we had to resort to using the yellow light for testing instead as no cars violated this from the clip we were given. Still we were able to exectute it as if there was someone violating this traffic rule.
